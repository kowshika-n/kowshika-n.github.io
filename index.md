### Expert Data Analyst | Web Researcher | Automation Developer

I am an experienced Business Process and Data Analyst with a demonstrated history of working in the Information Technology and Services industry for more than 5 years.

I am highly skilled in Web Research, Data Analytics, Project Management. 

I also develop Automation scripts using Selenium, Python and JavaScript to test applications and scrape websites.

I have worked on projects that entails data scraping, parsing, and normalizing large volumes of data. I can extract data from websites, Images, Videos, PDF files, XML documents, and many more formats. I can run multiple scrapers simultaneously to give most value in least amount of time. I can provide ouput data in any format the job requires.

I am open to a long-term as well as a short-term project. I have been working on large-scale data extraction projects and assure you I can handle your next big scraping project.
