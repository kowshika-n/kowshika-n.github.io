## Web Scraping and Automation

**Project description:** 
I am an expert in Test Automation using Selenium with Python/Java/PowerShell. I have 5 years of experience in developing, maintaining and executing automation test scripts. These scripts are developed to test web applications and also to scrape data and provide output as per the client requirements.

I have done Data Scraping/Data Mining using Selenium IDE as well. I also have experience in developing scripts for cross-browser automation for Chrome/Firefox/IE/Edge browsers. 

I can write custom Javascript or PowerShell or Batch scripts to automate data management, data cleanup, emailing, document processing, file conversion, etc..


I have extensive experience in automating following tasks:

	- Scrape any website/directory and extract the required dataset and export into client required formats (csv, excel, json, etc)
	
	- Scrape social media sites (Twitter/Facebook/Instagram) and extract profile data and feed data

	- Scrape e-commerce products, price and images from Amazon/eBay/Flipkart/PayTM

	- Parse unstructured text/pdf/image data into structured dataset

	- Cleanup excel data files using formulae/vba scripts and generate reports
	
	- Extract complete datasets from SharePoint/DropBox/Google Drive.
